# Assignment-1 - JavaScript Variables and Concatenation

## 🎯 Task
1. Create two variables named `numberOne` and `numberTwo` following proper naming conventions.
2. `numberOne` should have the value `10` (Number type).
3. `numberTwo` should have the value `20` (Number type).
4. Print results in the console using both **Normal Concatenate** and **Template Literals** as described below:

## 🧠 Concept
Variables should follow proper naming conventions (camelCase).
Normal concatenation can combine numbers as strings using + "" +.
Template Literals allow embedding expressions with ${} and support multi-line strings.
typeof can be used to check the data type of any expression.
