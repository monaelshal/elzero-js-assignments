  /*
   Code One will not work because it tries to access the HTML element
   before the page has fully loaded. The script is placed inside the head
   section, so when JavaScript runs, the element with id "el" does not
   exist yet in the DOM.

   As a result, document.getElementById("el") returns null,
   and the style cannot be applied.

   Code Two works because it waits for the window to load completely.
   Code Three works because it is placed after the element in the body,
   so the element already exists when the script runs.
