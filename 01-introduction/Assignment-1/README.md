# Assignment 1 - JavaScript Script Placement

## 🎯 Task
Understand the difference between placing JavaScript code in:
- `<head>` before the elements are loaded.
- Using `window.onload`.
- Placing the script after the element inside `<body>`.

## 🧠 Concept
- Code One: Does **not work** because it tries to access the element before the page is fully loaded.
- Code Two: Works using `window.onload` .
- Code Three: Works because the script is placed after.
## 💻 Code
The code changes the heading color to red successfully using the three methods.
